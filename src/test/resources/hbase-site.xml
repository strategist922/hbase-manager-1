		<name>hbase.client.write.buffer</name>
		<value>2097152</value>
		<description>Default size of the HTable client write buffer in bytes.
			A
			bigger buffer takes more memory -- on both the client and server
			side
			since server instantiates the passed write buffer to process
			it -- but
			a larger buffer size reduces the number of RPCs made.
			For an estimate
			of server-side memory-used, evaluate
			hbase.client.write.buffer *
			hbase.regionserver.handler.count
